<h2>📌 Reforecast vs Budget: Why the Sync Matters</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>2025 Reforecast</strong> data pulled from ABF represents near-final actuals entered by accountants — it becomes your “real” benchmark.
  The <strong>2026 Budget</strong> is driven by leasing team assumptions and rent projections.
  This pipeline ensures both datasets are aligned for strategic review and accurate year-over-year growth analysis.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bridges systems: ABF (accounting) → Yardi (leases) → Excel (reporting)</li>
  <li>Supports Q4 planning, executive reviews, and board-ready summaries</li>
  <li>Eliminates manual Excel work and formula mismatches</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>✅ Business Impact</h2>
<ul>
  <li>300+ hours saved annually</li>
  <li>Aligned Leasing + Accounting + Finance across shared forecasts</li>
