<h1 class="mb-4">📊 Budget & Reforecast Automation</h1>

<p>This solution automates the end-to-end workflow for annual budgeting and quarterly reforecasting across 400+ tenants and 100+ commercial buildings, syncing inputs from leasing and accounting teams.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Leasing Budget Pipeline</strong>: Automates forward-looking projections using SQL + Python based on leasing assumptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Leasing Reforecast Pipeline</strong>: Syncs near-final 2025 actuals from ABF and overlays rent projections from Yardi.</li>
  <li><strong>CapEx Pipeline</strong>: Automates project-level actuals, reforecasting, and approvals. (Coming Soon)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>✅ Business Impact</h2>
<ul>
  <li>300+ hours saved annually</li>
  <li>Aligned Leasing + Accounting + Finance across shared forecasts</li>
  <li>Single source of truth for both Budget and Reforecast comparison</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>🧠 It All Starts With Year 1 Leasing Budget</h2>
<p>
At the heart of this automation is the <strong>Year 1 leasing forecast</strong> — a dynamically built model combining:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In-place lease data</strong> pulled from Yardi (via SQL + Athena)</li>
  <li><strong>Leasing team assumptions</strong> on renewals, new leases, and downtime</li>
  <li><strong>Override logic</strong> that eliminates duplication and reflects accurate rent steps</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Excel interface</strong> for scenario runs and real-time rent projection updates</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔄 Syncing Budget & Reforecast Without Rebuilding</h2>
<p>Each year, two tasks need to happen in sync:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reforecast for 2025–2029</strong>: Updates to last year’s budget model to reflect actuals and material changes</li>
  <li><strong>New Budget for 2026–2030</strong>: Extending the model by one year (2030) for next-year planning</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thanks to this setup, we never rebuild from scratch. Instead, we reuse the same hybrid model by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pulling <strong>"Final Budget Book"</strong> from ABF for archived 2025–2029 baseline</li>
  <li>Pulling <strong>"IPP Budget Book"</strong> from ABF for active reforecast (same structure, updated by Accounting)</li>
  <li><strong>Renaming columns</strong> dynamically via Power Query (e.g., “/2025” → “/2026”)</li>
  <li><strong>Overlaying leasing rent projections</strong> for 2026–2030 from the Python pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>
The overlay logic uses the exact same core process from Year 1:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leasing assumptions + in-place leases are processed via Python and SQL</li>
  <li>Rent steps are unnested into month-level granularity</li>
  <li>Results feed into the Excel workbook, populating the future years dynamically</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧩 Hybrid Workbook — One Model, Two Purposes</h2>
<p>
Rather than build two separate files, I created a single Excel-based engine that serves both:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>2025–2029 Reforecast</strong>: Syncs to archived “Final Budget Book” and updated “IPP Budget Book” from Yardi ABF</li>
  <li><strong>2026–2030 Budget</strong>: Reuses same base logic and overlays new leasing projections using Python pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p>
Accountants use Power Query to pull actuals and material changes from ABF, while Leasing inputs feed Python-powered projections. The result:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fast, flashback-ready scenarios</strong> for budget planning</li>
  <li><strong>No rebuild required</strong> — just sync and extend forward</li>
</ul>

<h2>🚀 Why It Works</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Carry-forward modeling</strong>: One model supports both reforecast and next-year budget</li>
  <li><strong>Reusable Excel + backend logic</strong>: No rebuilding, just syncing and extending</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic year mapping</strong>: 2025 → 2026 handled programmatically in Power Query</li>
  <li><strong>Seamless Python integration</strong>: Rent projections flow into budgeting without manual re-entry</li>
</ul>

<p class="mt-4">
  All these steps make budget planning and reforecasting fully aligned — accountants, finance, and leasing all work off the same system with full transparency and speed.
